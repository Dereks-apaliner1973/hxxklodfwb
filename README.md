Wow, Contraataque. Just stepped out of it, and I swear, my brain's all scrambled eggs right now. So loud in there – the theater, I mean. People chatting like it's a street market, and the popcorn dude was on some mission to keep drowning us in buttery smells. My back hurts from the seat like I've been carrying a donkey.

> The start was like, BAM, in your face, with all these flashing lights. It felt like I was inside a pinball machine, getting bounced around, trying to catch my breath. And that scene! The one with the rooftop? What were they even doing up there, having a dance-off with pigeons? Made me laugh for no reason, pretty sure I snorted like an elephant at some point.

Oh, they totally nailed that car chase – forget Fast & Furious, this was more like Furious & Fast, if you get what I mean. And that one dude, with the moustache – he looked like he walked straight outta the '70s. Thought he was gonna start some disco dance right there in the middle of the gunfight. Really nuts. Someone asked me if I could download the movie later, and I was like, sure, unless it downloads me first, you know?

Random thought – you ever notice how the hero's hair never gets dirty? Mine would look like a mop fell in a mud puddle. And the villain, his voice was like a broken synthesizer trying to do opera. You gotta watch the movie just for that.

A speck of popcorn just fell out from my hoodie. Took me right out of my thoughts, almost screamed, thinking it was a spider or somethin'.

And there's this – oh man, what was it – yeah, waterfall scene where everything goes slow-mo, like gravity's just an option and not a rule. Reminded me of those times you're about to fall asleep and your body thinks it's skydiving. Why does it always happen like that?

function makeSenseOf() {
  for(let i = 0; i < movieLength; i++) {
    let thought = getRandomThought();
    if (thought === important) break;
    console.log(thought);
  }
  return undefined;
}
